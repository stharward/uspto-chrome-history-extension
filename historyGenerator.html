        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>The Google Search History Generator is a tool used for selecting and
        saving search queries as a PDF file, to be imported into an OC Set.  A
        full QRG on installation and use of this tool can be found on the <a
        target="_blank" href="http://ptoweb.uspto.gov/patents/pe2e/training/oc/">PE2E
        OC Training and Reference Page</a>.</p>
        <h2>Creating the &ldquo;Printable&rdquo; Search History</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>In the list above, click in the Show entries from past field and
          select an appropriate timeframe from the expanded menu.</li>
          <li>Click the checkboxes next to search strings that should appear on
          the resulting search history.</li>
          <li>Click the <b>Generate Printable Search History</b> button. A Print
          window displays. Click the Destination field, select Save as PDF, and
          click the Save button.</li>
          <li>If you need to generate multiple separate search history listings
          (<i>e.g.</i> you have searches for two applications mixed together),
          generate one, then reload this page, and generate the second one.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Putting the Search History in e-Red Folder and OC action</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>In OC, click the Import File(s) button in the toolbar. An Import
          Files window opens.</li>
          <li>If the Search History is saved in an e-Red Folder for the
          application, the file will be listed in the Import Files window; or
          navigate to the location of the saved search history file. Drag the
          PDF file to the &ldquo;Drag and drop files here&rdquo; portion of
          the Import File(s) window. The file will then be listed.</li>
          <li>Click to check the selection box next to the Search History
          file in the list.</li>
          <li>If not automatically populated, click the Doc Code field and
          select SRNT from the expanded list.</li>
          <li>Click the Import button and verify the file appears in the
          document list and was properly imported.</li>
        </ol>

          <h3>Version History and ChangeLog</h3>
          <h4>Version 5.3 (22 Jul 2020)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Reinstated handler for old Google Patents search interface.</li>
            <li>Updated documentation for OC.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Version 5.2 (16 Apr 2020)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>This extension now has official OCIO approval!</li>
            <li>Support Google Web searches.</li>
            <li>Removed support for old, discontinued Google Patents search interface.</li>
            <li>Updated documentation for OC.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Version 5.1 (18 Oct 2017)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Query processor update to handle Google tweaking the format of
              the Patents search URL.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Version 5 (27 Sep 2017)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Google launched a new version of Scholar, necessitating a rewrite
              of the query parameter extraction function.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Version 4 (1 Mar 2017)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>When eliminating duplicates of a query, keep the first instance
              of the query, rather than the last.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Version 3 (28 Feb 2017)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Added a function to filter out queries that were executed, but
              weren&rsquo;t displayed long enough to be reviewed. For example, if
              you realized that you misspelled a search term, and immediately ran
              a new query with the new term, you can filter out the old query.
              This is particularly useful when building a complicated query in
              Google Patents, because Chrome runs a new query each time you enter
              a new search term, and you probably don&rsquo;t care about keeping
              all the intermediate queries that were run while you were building
              up the whole query.</li>
            <li>Parse more fields from the Google Patents search.</li>
            <li>Format the output of Google Patents searches a little differently
              to make it easier to understand the structure of queries that used
              proximity or boolean operators.</li>
            <li>Ignore spurious entries in the Google Patents list caused when
              the URL of a publication also includes the query that yielded the
              publication.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Version 2 (1 Oct 2015)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Updated to handle the July 2015 overhaul of the Google Patents interface.
            The old interface is still around, so this extension still handles it for
            now.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Version 1 (29 May 2015)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Initial release.  Supports Google Books, Images, Patents and Scholar.</li>
          </ul>
