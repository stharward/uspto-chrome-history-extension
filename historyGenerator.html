        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>This extension allows you to create a &ldquo;printable&rdquo; web search history
        that can be converted to PDF and placed into e-Red Folder. Once the history is
        in eRF, you can import it into an Office action with OACS so that it gets added
        to IFW.</p>
        <h2>Creating the &ldquo;Printable&rdquo; Search History</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>In the list above, check the searches that you want to be shown on the
          search history listing that goes into IFW.</li>
          <li>Click the &ldquo;Generate Printable Search History&rdquo; button.  The
          checked entries will appear on the printable page.</li>
          <li>If you need to generate multiple separate search history listings
          (<i>e.g.</i> you have searches for two applications mixed together), generate
          one, then reload this page, and generate the second one.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Putting the Search History in e-Red Folder and IFW</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>When the printable search history is generated and the &ldquo;Print&rdquo;
          dialog comes up, select &ldquo;Save as PDF&rdquo; as the desination.</li>
          <li>Save the PDF into the e-Red Folder for the application.</li>
          <li>In OACS, import the PDF from e-Red Folder using the <tt><b>SRNT</b></tt>
          document type.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>About this Extension</h2>
        <p>This extension was written by <a href="mailto:soren.harward@uspto.gov">Soren
        Harward</a>, an examiner in AU1631.  Please send bug reports and feature
        requests (like new websites to support) to him. Don&rsquo;t contact the OCIO
        Helpdesk. Since this extension isn&rsquo;t official software, they&rsquo;ll
        have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
        <h3>Currently Supported Websites</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Google Books</li>
          <li>Google Images</li>
          <li>Google Patents</li>
          <li>Google Scholar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Version History and ChangeLog</h3>
        <h4>Version 3 (28 Feb 2017)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Added a function to filter out queries that were executed, but
            weren&rsquo;t displayed long enough to be reviewed. For example, if
            you realized that you misspelled a search term, and immediately ran
            a new query with the new term, you can filter out the old query.
            This is particularly useful when building a complicated query in
            Google Patents, because Chrome runs a new query each time you enter
            a new search term, and you probably don&rsquo;t care about keeping
            all the intermediate queries that were run while you were building
            up the whole query.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Version 2 (1 Oct 2015)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Updated to handle the July 2015 overhaul of the Google Patents interface.
          The old interface is still around, so this extension still handles it for
          now.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Version 1 (29 May 2015)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Initial release.  Supports Google Books, Images, Patents and Scholar.</li>
        </ul>
